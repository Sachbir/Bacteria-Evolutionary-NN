TODO:
    - Make a function to add/change the input neurons of a given neuron
        - This will either
            - add a new neuron from the existing set (with a greater depth value)
            - add a neuron to an existing connection
         - Do this before calculating depth values



Idea #3 for the neural network

1) Start with a network (original or inherited)
2) Hard-copy it to children's brain (solving the cloned behavior issue
3) Randomly vary the weight values
    - all weight values?
    - how much?
    - how do we reduce this over time?
4) Low chance of adding a new connection, either
    a) add an extra neuron between it and its previous connection
    b) find a neuron of a lower depth value and create a new connection
5) Add to depth
    - from output to input, add an input value
    - if an existing depth value exists, assign it the larger (deeper) value
