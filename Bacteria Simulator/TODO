Idea #3 for the neural network

1) Start with a network (original or inherited)
2) Hard-copy it to children's brain (solving the cloned behavior issue
3) Randomly vary the weight values
    - all weight values?
    - how much?
    - how do we reduce this over time?
4) Low chance of adding a new connection, either
    a) add an extra neuron between it and its previous connection
    b) find a neuron of a lower depth value and create a new connection
5) Add to depth
    - from output to input, add an input value
    - if an existing depth value exists, assign it the larger (deeper) value\

TODO:
    - Add a way for mutations to add new connections or add new neurons
         - Do this before calculating depth values
    - Speed things up
        - Main culprit seems to be the sigmoid function
    - Have some sort of death mechanic
        - Ideas
            - If population > x, starvation onsets
            - Bacteria are constantly starving, but there is more than an abundance of food (until too many bacteria)
                - It'd be easier/smarter for food to be a property of the world, rather than an object within it
